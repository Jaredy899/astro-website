# Linux

Over the course of contributing to open source projects and testing scripts, I’ve had the chance to try out a variety of Linux distributions. Each one has its own strengths, quirks, and communities. Here’s a quick rundown of my thoughts on each distro I’ve used so far.

---

## Debian ![Debian](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1854028?s=48&v=4)

Debian is solid and everywhere. It’s the base for so many other distributions, and you can always count on it to be stable. However, the base Debian system is often behind on package versions, which can be frustrating if you want the latest software.

---

## Ubuntu ![Ubuntu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4604537?s=48&v=4)

Ubuntu is based on Debian but is more up-to-date. It’s probably the most popular Linux desktop, but honestly, the desktop experience leaves a lot to be desired. It’s great for servers and gets the job done, but I find the desktop environment a bit lacking.

---

## Arch ![Arch](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4673648?s=48&v=4)

Arch is the definition of bleeding edge. It has all the packages you could ever want, and with the AUR (Arch User Repository), you can install just about anything. I use it on a spare laptop for tinkering. The downside is that it’s easy to break if you’re not careful, especially with frequent updates.

---

## Fedora ![Fedora](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3316637?s=48&v=4)

Fedora is another solid choice, and it’s always up-to-date. However, I’m a bit wary of it because of Red Hat’s recent moves towards closed source. Still, it’s a great distro for those who want the latest features and a polished experience.

---

## openSUSE ![openSUSE](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/623819?s=48&v=4)

openSUSE feels a bit slow compared to others, but it has a good community and is well-maintained. It uses RPM packages like Fedora, and it’s a solid choice if you want something a little different.

---

## Solus ![Solus](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6185495?s=48&v=4)

Solus is a niche distro focused on desktop environments. It has a friendly community and is well put together, but it’s not as standard as the other distros. You pretty much have to use their package manager, but they have almost everything you’d need.

---

## Void ![Void](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37247796?s=48&v=4)

Void Linux is small, fast, and updated regularly. It uses the runit init system instead of systemd, which helps it boot quickly and stay lightweight. It’s flexible and a great choice if you want something minimal and different.

---

## Alpine ![Alpine](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7600810?s=48&v=4)

Alpine is very small and also uses OpenRC for init, making it fast and efficient. It’s popular for Docker containers and server use, but you can run a desktop environment on it if you want. It’s a great choice for lightweight systems.

---

## NixOS ![NixOS](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487568?s=48&v=4)

NixOS is unique because it’s declarative: you define your entire system configuration in a single file, and the system builds itself from that. This makes it incredibly easy to replicate your setup on another machine. However, installing and uninstalling software isn’t as straightforward as with other distros, and there’s a bit of a learning curve.

---

Every distro has its own vibe and use case. I’ve enjoyed exploring them all, and I’ll probably keep hopping around as I keep learning and contributing. If you’re curious about any of these, I recommend giving them a try and seeing which one fits your workflow best!
